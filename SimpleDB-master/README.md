#SimpleDB
It's a basic database management system my partner and I wrote for UC Berkeley's Database class CS186. It is called SimpleDB and consists of 4 projects.
###SimpleDB consists of:
1. Classes that represent fields, tuples, and tuple schemas;
2. Classes that apply predicates and conditions to tuples;
3. One or more access methods (e.g., heap files) that store relations on disk and provide a way to iterate through tuples of those relations;
4. A collection of operator classes (e.g., select, join, insert, delete, etc.) that process tuples;
5. A buffer pool that caches active tuples and pages in memory and handles concurrency control and transactions (neither of which you need to worry about for this project); and,
6. A catalog that stores information about available tables and their schemas.
